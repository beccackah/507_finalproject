This Python script retrieves movie details from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, using a provided API key. The script first loads a list of top movies and their ratings from a JSON file called "top_movies.json".

It then initializes a dictionary to store the details of each movie and a SortedDict to store the movie titles sorted by their rating. The script then loops through the top movies and sends a GET request to the TMDb API to search for each movie by title.

If the movie is found in the API search results, its ID is used to retrieve the full movie details. The script then extracts the relevant movie details, including the movie's title, rating, and genres, and stores them in the movie_details dictionary and the cache file "movie_details_cache.json" to avoid making duplicate API calls.

The script then waits for 0.1 seconds to avoid exceeding the TMDb API rate limit and prints the movie details. Finally, it prints the movie titles sorted by rating using a binary search tree (SortedDict), along with the respective rating and genres.
